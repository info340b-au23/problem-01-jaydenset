    <p>
        <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Aang">In Avatar the Last Airbender</a>, Aang is the main protagonist and is an air nomad. 
        As the avatar of his time he is the only person who has the ability to master all 4 elements of bending which include fire, earth, 
        water, and air. By doing so he will be able to complete his mission of bringing peace back to the world and stopping the 
        fire lord from conquering every nation and continouing the 100 year war.
